**1.Learning = Representation + evaluation + optimization**

Representation:

	Instances
		K-nearest neighbor
		Support vector machines
	Hyperplanes
		Naive Bayes
		Logistic regression
	Decision trees
	Set of rules
		Propositional rules
		Logic programs
	Neural networks
	Graphical models
		Bayesian networks
		Conditional random fields
		
Evaluation:

	Accuracy/Error rate
	Precision and recall
	Squared error
	Likelihod
	Posterior probability
	Information gain
	K-L divergence
	Cost/Utility
	Margin
	
Optimization:

	Combinatorial optimization
		Greedy search
		Beam search
		Branch-and-bound
	Continuous optimization
		Unconstrained
			Gradient descent
			Conjugate gradient
			Quasi-Newton methods
		Constrained
			Linear programming
			Quadratic programming
